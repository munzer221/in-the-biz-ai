# In The Biz AI - Copilot Instructions

**Knowledge cutoff:** June 2024
**Current date:** December 31, 2025

**These instructions are automatically applied to every Copilot chat session.**

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION RULE

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT add implementation details, feature summaries, or "how things work" documentation to these copilot instructions.

**Where to document instead:**
- **Feature completion:** Update `docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`
- **Implementation guides:** Add to relevant phase docs in `docs/phases/`
- **New features:** Document in `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` (if not started) or roadmap (if completed)
- **Technical specs:** Create dedicated docs in `docs/` folder

**These copilot instructions should ONLY contain:**
- Critical workflow rules (device IDs, deployment commands, theme rules)
- Things the AI MUST remember every session
- Rules that prevent breaking the app (like "never hardcode colors")

## 📱 DEVICE CODE FOR ANDROID PHONE

**User's Android Device:** Samsung Phone (Seeker)
**Device ID:** `SM02G4061996968`
**IP Address:** `10.0.0.65`

**To run the app on the user's phone:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d SM02G4061996968
```
**To run the app wirelessly:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d 10.0.0.65:5555
```

**User's Android Tablet:** Samsung Galaxy Tab (SM X210)
**Tablet ID:** `R92X3069WGW`
**IP Address:** `10.0.0.50`

**To run the app on the user's tablet:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d R92X3069WGW
```

**Running Multiple Devices Simultaneously:**
- Flutter can only run one device per terminal session.
- Open two separate terminals or use VS Code's split terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+5`) to run both devices simultaneously.
- When you press `r` (hot reload) in either terminal, it will reload **only that device**. But when you **save a file** in VS Code, both devices will hot reload automatically at the same time.
- **Save file (Ctrl+S):** Both devices reload 🔄🔄
- **Press `r` in Terminal 1:** Only phone reloads 🔄
- **Press `r` in Terminal 2:** Only tablet reloads 🔄
- **Press `R` (capital):** Hot restart for that specific device
- **Press `q`:** Quit that specific device
- Hitting **Ctrl+S** will trigger a hot reload on both devices. It's a handy trick when you want to manually reload everything without making an actual code change.
- You can also just add a space somewhere and then delete it, then hit save - Flutter will reload both devices even though nothing actually changed in the code.

**Wireless Debugging Setup (ADB over Wi-Fi) (NEW - December 29, 2025):**

These steps allow for wireless debugging, avoiding USB cable issues.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  Android SDK Platform-Tools installed.
2.  USB debugging enabled on your Android device.
3.  Both your computer and Android device connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

**Setup Steps:**

1.  **Connect Device via USB:** Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

2.  **Enable TCP/IP Mode:** Run the following command in the terminal, replacing `<device_id>` with your device's ID (obtained from `adb devices`):
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s <device_id> tcpip 5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s SM02G4061996968 tcpip 5555
    ```

3.  **Find Device IP Address:** On your Android device, go to **Settings** → **About phone** → **Status** → **IP address** or **Settings** → **Connections** → **Wi-Fi** → tap your connected network.

4.  **Connect via Wi-Fi:** Run the following command, replacing `<device_ip_address>` with the IP address you found:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe connect <device_ip_address>:5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe connect 10.0.0.98:5555
    ```

5.  **Verify Connection:** Run `flutter devices` to see your device listed as `<device_ip_address>:5555`.

6.  **Run Wirelessly:** Deploy your Flutter app wirelessly using:
    ```powershell
    cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d <device_ip_address>:5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d 10.0.0.98:5555
    ```

**Batch File for Easy Reconnection:**

Create a batch file (e.g., `connect-wifi.bat`) with the following content, replacing the IP addresses with your device's IPs:

```bat
@echo off
REM All device IP addresses
set TABLET_IP=10.0.0.50
set SEEKER_IP=10.0.0.65
set SN339D_IP=10.0.0.98
set ADB_PATH=C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe

echo Connecting all devices over Wi-Fi...
echo.
echo Connecting Tablet (SM X210)...
%ADB_PATH% connect %TABLET_IP%:5555
echo.
echo Connecting Seeker Phone...
%ADB_PATH% connect %SEEKER_IP%:5555
echo.
echo Connecting SN339D Phone...
%ADB_PATH% connect %SN339D_IP%:5555

echo.
echo Available devices:
%ADB_PATH% devices

echo.
echo To disconnect all: adb disconnect
pause
```

**How to Run the Batch File:**

*   **From File Explorer:** Navigate to your project folder (`In The Biz AI`) and double-click `connect-wifi.bat`.
*   **From VS Code Terminal:** Type `connect-wifi.bat` and press Enter.

**When to Use the Batch File:**

*   After restarting your phone/tablet.
*   After disconnecting from Wi-Fi.
*   When `flutter devices` doesn't show the wireless devices.

**Device-Specific Wireless Run Commands:**

*   Tablet: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.50:5555`
*   Seeker: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.65:5555`
*   SN339D: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.98:5555`

**Making IP Addresses Permanent (DHCP Reservation):**

1.  Log into your router (usually `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1` in a browser).
2.  Find **DHCP Reservation** or **Static IP Assignment**.
3.  Reserve these IPs for each device's MAC address:
    *   Tablet: `10.0.0.50`
    *   Seeker: `10.0.0.65`
    *   SN339D: `10.0.0.98`

**Important Notes:**

*   Keep both devices on the same Wi-Fi network.
*   The first connection requires USB (for enabling TCP/IP mode).
*   IP address may change - if the connection fails, check your IP and update the batch file.
*   Wireless debugging uses more battery than USB.

## 🎨 THEME SYSTEM - CRITICAL RULES (UPDATED December 30, 2025)

**NEVER use hardcoded colors. ALWAYS use AppTheme.**

### General Theming Philosophy (NEW - December 30, 2025):
- Professional apps use a **primary accent color** (green, purple, blue) but keep most of the UI **neutral** (whites, grays, blacks) so the accent color **pops** instead of overwhelming everything.
- Use the accent color **sparingly** - for buttons, highlights, gradients, and key interactive elements.
- **Backgrounds should be neutral** (almost black - `#0D0D0D`) in dark themes to make the colored containers pop.

### Color Usage Rules:
**✅ CORRECT:**
```dart
Container(
  color: AppTheme.primaryGreen,
  child: Icon(Icons.add, color: AppTheme.textPrimary),
)
```

**❌ WRONG:**
```dart
Container(
  color: const Color(0xFF00D632),  // NEVER hardcode
  child: Icon(Icons.add, color: Colors.white),  // NEVER use Colors.xxx
)
```

### Available Theme Colors:
- **Primary:** `AppTheme.primaryGreen` (main brand color - changes with theme)
- **Backgrounds:** `AppTheme.darkBackground`, `AppTheme.cardBackground`, `AppTheme.cardBackgroundLight`
- **Text:** `AppTheme.textPrimary`, `AppTheme.textSecondary`, `AppTheme.textMuted`
- **Accents:** `AppTheme.accentRed`, `AppTheme.accentBlue`, `AppTheme.accentYellow`, `AppTheme.accentOrange`, `AppTheme.accentPurple`
- **Semantic:** `AppTheme.successColor`, `AppTheme.warningColor`, `AppTheme.dangerColor`, `AppTheme.scheduledShiftColor`
- **Charts:** `AppTheme.chartGreen1`, `AppTheme.chartGreen2`, `AppTheme.chartGreen3`
- **Gradients:** `AppTheme.greenGradient`
  // Hero card background - always dark, even in light themes
- **Hero Card:** `AppTheme.heroCardBackground`

### How Theming Works:
1. User selects theme in Settings → Appearance (11 themes available)
2. Theme saved to database via `ThemeProvider.setTheme()`
3. App automatically restarts and loads new theme from database
4. `ThemeProvider` updates `AppTheme.setColors()` with theme-specific colors
5. **ALL colors update** - buttons, text, charts, badges, everything

### Available Themes:
**Dark Themes:**
- Finance Green (Default) - Classic green finance app
- Midnight Blue - Professional blue tones
- Purple Reign - Royal purple
- Ocean Breeze - Teal/aqua
- Sunset Glow - Orange/warm tones
- Forest Night - Nature green
- PayPal Blue - PayPal-inspired
- Finance Pro - Crypto blue/purple

**Light Themes:**
- Light Mode - Classic white background with emerald green accent
- Finance Light - PayPal-inspired blue theme with off-white background
- Soft Purple - Gentle purple theme

### When Creating New UI:
- **NEVER** use `Colors.green`, `Colors.blue`, `Color(0xFFXXXXXX)`, etc.
- **ALWAYS** use `AppTheme.primaryGreen`, `AppTheme.accentBlue`, etc.
- If you need opacity: `AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.5)`
- For text on colored backgrounds: `AppTheme.primaryOnDark` or `AppTheme.textPrimary`
- For AppBar titles and other text directly on backgrounds, use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to automatically adjust to the current theme.
- **Hero Card Backgrounds:** Hero cards must maintain their dark background even when in Light Mode. Use `AppTheme.heroCardBackground` which is **ALWAYS** the pure black color (`#000000`), regardless of whether you're in Light Mode or any other theme.
- **Hero Card Gradient Colors:** The hero card gradient must ALWAYS use the dark mode gradient colors, regardless of the theme.
- **Header Icon Color:** Header icons (in app bars, etc.) must use `AppTheme.headerIconColor` to automatically switch between black (for light themes) and white (for dark themes) based on the background luminance.
- **"Add Job" and "Restore Deleted Jobs" Buttons:** In the "My Jobs" section of the settings screen, the text on these buttons should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between white and black based on the current theme.
- **"Export PDF" and "Export CSV" Options:** In the stats screen's export dropdown, the text on these options should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between white and black based on the current theme.
- **"Clear Chat" Option:** In the chat assistant, the "Clear Chat" text should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between black in light mode and white in dark mode.
- **Job Tab Text Color:** When a job is selected in light mode, the text should be white for better visibility.
- **Job Filter/Period Filter Text Color:** When a job is selected, or one of the filters of day, week, month, year or all is selected on the hero card, the inner text should be white.

### Additional Hero Card Rules:
- **Hero Card Background:** Hero cards must maintain a distinct background even when in Light Mode. Use `AppTheme.heroCardBackground` which defaults to a dark color, but adapts to a lighter gray (`#3D3D3D`) in light mode to ensure visual harmony.
- **Hero Card Gradient Colors:** The hero card gradient must use the current theme's primary and accent colors, ensuring the gradient adapts to the selected theme while remaining visible.

### Correct Hero Card Implementation
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../theme/app_theme.dart';

/// Universal Hero Card widget - dark background with green/blue gradient
/// Used for dashboard earnings, shift summaries, job cards, etc.
class HeroCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final EdgeInsets? padding;
  final EdgeInsets? margin;
  final double? borderRadius;

  const HeroCard({
    super.key,
    required this.child,
    this.padding,
    this.margin,
    this.borderRadius,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Detect if we're in light mode by checking background luminance
    final isLightMode = AppTheme.darkBackground.computeLuminance() > 0.5;

    return Container(
      margin: margin,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: isLightMode
            ? const Color(0xFF5A5A5A) // Light mode: #5A5A5A (adjust lighter/darker as needed)
            : const Color(0xFF1A1A1A), // Dark mode: #1A1A1A
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(borderRadius ?? AppTheme.radiusXL),
      ),
      child: Container(
        padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(24),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            colors: [
              AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.15),
              AppTheme.accentBlue.withOpacity(0.1),
            ],
          ),
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(borderRadius ?? AppTheme.radiusXL),
          border: Border.all(
            color: AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.3),
            width: 1,
          ),
        ),
        child: child,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Web Deployment Instructions (NEW - December 31, 2025):

These steps are a **general guide** based on past experiences. Actual deployment may require adjustments.

#### 1. Set the Base Href:

-   Before building for the web, ALWAYS specify the base href:
    ```bash
    flutter build web --release --base-href=/in-the-biz-ai/
    ```
-   This tells the app where it will be hosted.

#### 2. Verify `manifest.json`:

*   Ensure the `web/manifest.json` file exists and is correctly formatted JSON.
*   Double-check the paths to icons.

#### 3. Enable Google Sign-In for Web:

-   In `lib/services/auth_service.dart`, make sure the Google Sign-In logic is correctly implemented for web.
-   Use the correct client ID for web.
*  On web you can't use `authenticate()` - you MUST use the Google button rendered by the SDK.

#### 4. Create a GitHub Repository:

*   Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `in-the-biz-ai`).
*   Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license.

#### 5. Configure Git:

```powershell
cd "c:\\Users\\Brandon 2021\\Desktop\In The Biz AI"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/in-the-biz-ai.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### 6. Create and Deploy to `gh-pages` Branch:

```powershell
flutter build web --release --base-href=/in-the-biz-ai/
git checkout -b gh-pages
git add build/web
git commit -m "Deploy web app to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages --force
```

#### 7. Enable GitHub Pages:

*   Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
*   Navigate to the "Pages" section.
*   Set the source to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   Set the folder to `/build/web`.

#### 8. Test Thoroughly:

*   Access the deployed app via the GitHub Pages URL.
*   Test Google Sign-In.
*   Check for any errors in the browser console.

#### Troubleshooting:

*   **404 Errors:** Double-check the base href, file paths, and GitHub Pages settings.
*   **Google Sign-In Issues:** Ensure the web client ID is correctly configured and that the implementation follows the latest `google_sign_in` package guidelines.
*    **Large File Errors:** Make sure to exclude large files and folders like `node_modules` and `.dart_tool` from the repo.

#### 9. Deploy to Custom Domain (NEW - December 31, 2025):

To deploy to your custom domain `inthebiz.app`, you need to configure GitHub Pages to use that domain:

1.  **Add a CNAME file** to your `gh-pages` branch:
    *   Create a file named `CNAME` (no extension) in the `build/web` directory.
    *   Put one line in it: `inthebiz.app`
    *   Commit and push it

2.  **Update your DNS records** at your domain registrar (Vercel Domains):
    *   Go to your domain settings
    *   Add these CNAME records:
        *   `@` → `munzer221.github.io` (or use the A records GitHub provides if CNAME isn't supported)

3.  **Enable HTTPS** in GitHub Pages:
    *   Go to your repo Settings → Pages
    *   Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after GitHub Pages recognizes your domain)

### Security Rules (NEW - December 31, 2025):

- **NEVER commit `.env` files to Git.** These files contain sensitive API keys and credentials.
- **ALWAYS add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.** This prevents accidental commits.
- **When creating new API keys, restrict their usage** to only the necessary services (e.g., Generative Language API for Gemini).
- **Rotate API keys immediately** if they are compromised (e.g., accidentally committed to a public repository).
- **Monitor API key usage** in the cloud console to detect suspicious activity.
- **For web deployments, configure Docker Desktop to start automatically** to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly.
- **When using Docker on Windows, restart the terminal** after installing Docker Desktop to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly.

## 🗄️ SUPABASE DATABASE MIGRATIONS (NEW - December 31, 2025)

**DO NOT use `supabase db push` or `supabase migration up`** - these require Docker and are unreliable on Windows.

### How to Run SQL Migrations:

**Use the Node.js Script (Only Method):**
```powershell
node scripts/run-migration.mjs <migration-file>.sql
```

**Example:**
```powershell
node scripts/run-migration.mjs supabase/migrations/20251231000000_create_chat_messages.sql
```

### Required Setup:

1. **Script Location:** `scripts/run-migration.mjs` (already created)
2. **SQL Files Location:** `supabase/migrations/` directory
3. **Required Packages:** `pg` and `dotenv` (already installed via `npm install pg dotenv`)
4. **Environment Variable:** `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file

**DATABASE_URL format:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### How It Works:

The script (`scripts/run-migration.mjs`):
- Reads the SQL file from the migrations directory
- Connects directly to PostgreSQL using the `pg` npm package
- Executes the SQL in a transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK on error)
- Shows helpful error messages if it fails

### Getting the Database Password:

1. Go to: **https://app.supabase.com/project/[PROJECT-ID]/settings/database**
2. Click **"Reset Database Password"** (safe - only affects this project)
3. Copy the new password
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with the new password
5. Run the migration

### Creating New Migrations:

1. Create a new SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`
2. **Naming format:** `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` (e.g., `20251231235959_add_new_table.sql`)
3. Write your SQL with proper error handling
4. Run: `node scripts/run-migration.mjs supabase/migrations/[filename].sql`
