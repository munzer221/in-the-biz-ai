## 1. 🚗 RIDESHARE DRIVERS (Uber/Lyft)

### Top 5 Metrics Workers Care About
1. **Earnings Per Hour ($/hr)** - Most important single metric; drivers constantly compare hourly rates
2. **Acceptance Rate** - Required to maintain driver status; affects access to surge pricing and premium rides
3. **Surge Pricing Availability** - When surge happens in their area; directly multiplies earnings
4. **Tips** - Can range from 0-50% of total income depending on region and time of day
5. **Cancellation Rate** - Too many cancellations = deactivation risk + penalties

### Good Day vs Bad Day
- **Good Day:** 4-5 rides/hour, consistent surge pricing ($1.5-2x multiplier), high tips (15-20% of fares), peak hours worked
- **Bad Day:** 1-2 rides/hour, no surge, poor tips, dead miles driving between pickups, sitting idle waiting for rides

### Data That Helps Earn More
- Knowing when surge pricing peaks (Friday-Saturday nights, holidays, weather events)
- Understanding which areas generate better tips and acceptance rates
- Tracking which times of day produce highest $/hour
- Monitoring customer ratings (high ratings unlock premium rides and better matching)
- Recognizing market saturation vs opportunity windows

### Unique/Unusual Tracking Needs
- **Dead Miles:** Driving without passengers (between pickups, repositioning)
- **Vehicle Costs:** Fuel, maintenance, insurance, depreciation (critical for profitability)
- **Acceptance Rate Monitoring:** Must manually track or use third-party apps
- **Surge Prediction:** Workers use social mapping to predict surge before it happens
- **Rejection Patterns:** Which ride types/locations lead to cancellations

### Current Tracking Methods
- Uber/Lyft built-in dashboards (limited; don't show all desired metrics)
- Third-party apps like TripLog, Stride (for tax/mileage)
- Manual spreadsheets (surprisingly common)
- Screenshots of earnings (archaic but common)

### Pain Points with Current Tracking
- Apps don't show acceptance rate clearly
- No prediction tools for surge pricing
- Difficult to correlate earnings with specific times/locations
- Poor visibility into what caused a "bad day"
- Vehicle cost tracking is fragmented across multiple apps

### Gaps Workers Wish Existed
- Real-time surge prediction (not just current surge)
- Automatic dead mileage tracking with maps
- Comparison: "your hourly rate this week vs same week last month"
- Location-based earnings analysis ("which neighborhoods pay best?")
- Customer tier matching (which customer ratings give better tips?)

## 2. 📦 FOOD DELIVERY DRIVERS (DoorDash/Uber Eats/Grubhub)

### Top 5 Metrics Workers Care About
1. **Deliveries Per Hour** - More deliveries = more base pay + tips
2. **Average Payout Per Delivery** - Base pay ranges $2-8, tips vary wildly
3. **Acceptance Rate** - Affects algorithm ranking and order quality
4. **Tip Rate** - % of orders that include tips (highly inconsistent)
5. **Active Time vs Waiting Time** - Many hours spent waiting between orders

### Good Day vs Bad Day
- **Good Day:** 4-5 deliveries/hour, $6-8 avg per delivery, high tips (40%+ of orders), short wait times between pickups
- **Bad Day:** 1-2 deliveries/hour, low pay orders ($2-3), very few tips, long waits between pickups, restaurant delays

### Data That Helps Earn More
- Knowing which restaurants are fastest (less waiting = more deliveries/hour)
- Understanding which neighborhoods/ZIP codes have highest tip rates
- Identifying peak hours for delivery demand
- Recognizing when order acceptance rate is low and to stop accepting
- Tracking which apps (DoorDash vs Uber Eats) are busier on specific days

### Unique/Unusual Tracking Needs
- **Restaurant Performance:** How long does each restaurant take to prepare orders?
- **Zone Saturation:** How many delivery drivers are active in zone (affects wait times)
- **Order Quality:** Is this a "stacked order" (multiple deliveries)? Which pay better?
- **Tip Predictability:** Which restaurants/neighborhoods have tippers?
- **Zone Hopping:** When to move to a busier zone

### Current Tracking Methods
- App dashboards (very limited)
- Manual notes/screenshots
- Spreadsheets tracking daily earnings only
- Some use Google Maps to track delivery patterns

### Pain Points
- Can't see tips in advance on most orders (can't cherry-pick)
- Algorithm penalizes declining low-tip orders
- No visibility into restaurant wait times (only during delivery)
- Hard to know if switching zones will improve earnings
- Apps don't show what caused a slow day

### Gaps Workers Wish Existed
- **Predictive Tipping:** Historical data showing which restaurants/addresses tip
- **Restaurant Wait Times:** Real-time data before accepting order
- **Zone Comparison:** "Is zone A or B busier right now?"
- **Delivery Stacking Analysis:** "When do stacked orders happen and where?"

## 📊 CROSS-INDUSTRY PATTERNS

### Universal Metrics ALL Workers Want
1. **True Hourly Rate** - Including all income streams, accounting for unpaid time
2. **Good Day vs Bad Day Indicators** - What caused the variation?
3. **Income Forecasting** - "What will I earn next week/month?"
4. **Performance Trends** - "Am I getting better or worse? vs peers?"
5. **Time Allocation Analysis** - Where does time actually go?

### Universal Challenges with Current Tracking
- **Fragmented Data:** Using multiple apps/systems
- **No Holistic View:** Income from various sources not easily comparable
- **Manual Logging:** Still prevalent even in app-heavy industries
- **Poor Predictability:** Hard to forecast future earnings
- **No Context:** "Bad day" but no clear reason why

### Why Workers Switch to Manual Tracking
- Built-in app dashboards miss key metrics
- Want to track things the official app doesn't support
- Don't trust company systems for personal data
- Need historical data for tax purposes
- Want data the way THEY want to see it

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS FOR "IN THE BIZ" APP

### 1. The App is Already Strong for Servers/Bartenders
Your current shift tracking matches hospitality workers perfectly:
- ✅ Hours worked + hourly rate
- ✅ Tip tracking (cash + credit)
- ✅ Event/location tracking
- ✅ Quick income calculation
- ✅ Historical data for taxes

### 2. You Can EXPAND to Other Industries with Minimal Core Changes
All industries need:
- Date/Time tracking
- Hours/Units of work
- Income breakdown (base + tips/commission/bonuses)
- Mileage (if relevant)
- Notes for context

### 3. The Biggest Opportunity: Industry-Specific Templates
Rather than building separate apps, create **job templates** that automatically:
- Show/hide relevant fields (rideshare shows miles; salon shows client count)
- Calculate metrics correctly (gig workers need true hourly rate after expenses)
- Provide relevant analytics ("best time of day" for rideshare; "retention rate" for trainers)

### 4. What Workers Actually Want (Ranked by Difficulty)

**Easy (2-4 weeks):**
- Export data to CSV/PDF
- Basic trend charts ("earnings by day of week")
- Comparison to historical period

**Medium (4-8 weeks):**
- Industry-specific fields in shift creation
- Custom calculated metrics per industry
- Alerts/notifications (burnout risk, trend warnings)

**Hard (8+ weeks):**
- Forecasting models
- Peer comparison (anonymized)
- Integration with external data (Uber API, weather data for construction)

### 5. Monetization Opportunity
This research shows workers WILL PAY for:
- True income forecasting ("You'll earn $2,400 next week")
- Peer benchmarking ("You're earning 8% above market rate")
- Burnout/saturation warnings
- Optimization recommendations ("Stop accepting orders in Zone C; try Zone B instead")

Most workers currently have 0-1 tracking tools. A comprehensive tool covering their specific industry would have high perceived value.
